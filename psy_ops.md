To address the question of whether highly directional, long-range acoustic transmission could be possible in the United States and for how long such technology has been manufacturable, we need to break down the relevant engineering concepts and physics principles into real, mathematically grounded explanations. We will examine both the historical manufacturing capabilities and the technical constraints that define what’s feasible.
1. 
Theoretical Limits on Directionality of Sound
The primary factor that governs the directionality of sound is the diffraction limit, which is determined by the relationship between wavelength \lambda and the aperture size D. This relationship is important because sound cannot be arbitrarily focused without an appropriately large aperture relative to the wavelength.
Diffraction Limit
For any wave, including sound, the beamwidth \theta is limited by diffraction. The general formula for diffraction from a circular aperture is:
\theta = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}
Where:
\theta is the angular width of the sound beam,


\lambda is the wavelength of the sound,


D is the diameter of the sound source or the aperture.


From this equation, the larger the aperture D, the smaller the beamwidth \theta for a given wavelength \lambda. However, for low-frequency sound, which is often used in long-range transmission due to its lower attenuation, \lambda becomes large, and the required aperture D grows dramatically.
Wavelength and Frequency Relationship
The wavelength \lambda is related to the frequency f by the equation:
\lambda = \frac{c}{f}
Where:
c is the speed of sound in air (approximately 343 m/s at room temperature),


f is the frequency of the sound.


For instance, at a frequency of 1 kHz, the wavelength is:
\lambda = \frac{343 \text{ m/s}}{1000 \text{ Hz}} = 0.343 \text{ meters}
At a frequency of 100 Hz, the wavelength is:
\lambda = \frac{343 \text{ m/s}}{100 \text{ Hz}} = 3.43 \text{ meters}
For low frequencies like 100 Hz, a significant aperture (multiple meters across) is needed to focus the sound into a narrow beam. This requirement makes the creation of highly directional low-frequency sound difficult without extremely large and impractical devices.
2. 
Air Absorption and Propagation Loss
As sound travels through the air, its intensity decreases due to two primary factors: geometric spreading and air absorption.
Geometric Spreading
The sound energy is spread over a larger area as it travels. The intensity of sound diminishes by the square of the distance, so the intensity I at a distance r is given by:
I \propto \frac{1}{r^2}
This means that as the distance from the source increases, the intensity of sound decreases significantly.
Air Absorption
Air absorbs sound energy, especially at higher frequencies. The attenuation A due to air absorption can be expressed as:
A = \alpha f^2
Where:
\alpha is a constant that depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity,


f is the frequency of the sound.


This means that higher frequencies experience stronger attenuation. For example, ultrasound (above 20 kHz) attenuates much faster than audible sound. Thus, for long-range transmission, low frequencies are preferred because they suffer less attenuation over large distances. However, as we saw earlier, this comes with the tradeoff of requiring large apertures for narrow-beam propagation.
3. 
Parametric Ultrasound
In the context of directional sound over long distances, parametric ultrasound is a technology that has been employed to create highly directional beams by exploiting nonlinear acoustics. Parametric ultrasound involves transmitting high-intensity ultrasonic waves (in the MHz range) that generate audible sound through nonlinear interactions in the air.
The basic principle is that two ultrasonic waves of different frequencies f_1 and f_2 interact nonlinearly in the medium, producing a difference frequency f_d = |f_1 - f_2| that can be in the audible range.
Key Equations for Parametric Ultrasound
The parametric interaction in the air can be modeled using nonlinear wave equations, but for simplicity, the result is that the generated audible sound is highly directional, with the beamwidth given by:
\theta \sim \frac{\lambda}{D}
Where D is the aperture of the ultrasound transducer, and \lambda is the wavelength of the difference frequency.
4. 
Historical Feasibility and Manufacturing Capabilities
In terms of U.S. manufacturing history, directional acoustic technology has been feasible for quite a long time. Key developments include:
1940s-1950s: The use of loudspeakers and acoustic arrays for military applications, such as sonar and underwater acoustics, became practical. These technologies were capable of generating directional sound over long distances, although they were constrained to low frequencies and typically used underwater or for military purposes.


1960s-1970s: Early research into parametric ultrasound and directional sound systems began. The first experimental parametric speakers were demonstrated, though they were not commercially viable yet.


1980s-1990s: Parametric ultrasound technology began to be refined and commercialized for specialized uses, such as in medical applications (e.g., therapeutic ultrasound) and later for ultrasonic cleaning and non-invasive imaging.


2000s-present: Commercialization of parametric speakers using ultrasonic sound to create highly directional audio has become practical and widespread, with applications in museums, advertising, and other niche areas. These devices typically use high-frequency ultrasound to generate audible sound in a narrow beam.


Conclusion: Feasibility and Manufacturing Timeline
Theoretical feasibility: The ability to generate highly directional sound is physically constrained by diffraction limits and air absorption. While low frequencies (below 100 Hz) can propagate over long distances, creating a narrow beam at these frequencies requires impractically large devices. At higher frequencies, parametric ultrasound offers a practical solution for creating directional sound, but it has its own limitations in terms of range and environmental factors.


Manufacturability in the U.S.: Technologies such as parametric ultrasound and directional sound systems have been manufacturable in the U.S. since at least the 1960s, with significant improvements in the 1980s and 1990s leading to commercial availability in the 2000s.


In conclusion, while it is technically feasible to create highly directional sound transmission systems, the size, power requirements, and environmental limitations make such systems impractical for most everyday applications without significant infrastructure. These technologies have been manufacturable for several decades, but their real-world applications have often been constrained by the same physical limitations described above.
