Judge [____]
BO SHANG’S EMERGENCY MOTION TO (1) STOP ONGOING PLAINTIFF-SPECIFIC ROOT-OF-TRUST SIGNING-CHAIN TARGETING AND PRESERVE EVIDENCE, (2) AUTHORIZE LIMITED EARLY “FACT-OF-USE” DISCOVERY, AND (3) KEEP SENSITIVE IDENTIFIERS OFF THE PUBLIC DOCKET
Plaintiff Bo Shang (pro se) respectfully requests a narrow emergency order that does three things: 
Stops Plaintiff-specific interference alleged here—specifically, conduct consistent with misuse of vendor Root-of-Trust (“RoT”) code-signing chains (including RSA-2048) to cause Plaintiff’s devices to accept validly signed but non-ordinary firmware/OS/system components while this case is pending;


Preserves records before they are overwritten or lost; and


Allows a small set of early “fact-of-use” questions so the Court can promptly answer the threshold question: did any Defendant do this to Plaintiff (or direct it), yes or no?—without compelling public disclosure of sensitive technical methods.


Due to the unusual nature of events forced onto the Plaintiff against his will entirely, namely how these attackers force a fight by amphetamine response every time I even suspect a little thing off rather than think I’m myself crazy, by their design, I’m going to attempt to hypothesize the rationale US Federal Judges use when ruling. I hypothesize that US Federal Judge rules based on what they believe are in the interests of the United States. I’m 100% certain that MA judges have been aware of some of this, yet chose to ignore these facts while ruling, at least that’s sure what it would sound like if anyone listened to the tapes.
One could ponder many reasons why others, even those who may be aware of these events, don’t want to come out and admit to their knowledge of them. 
I did not choose to attempt the impossible and survive the United States + other willing collaborators including the People’s Republic of China and United Kingdom. I sure hope I have done enough to have a TRO motion granted because I’m not sure what better alternative there exist for me at least. I have no clue what others feel about me but common sense suggest that I’m an awkward nuisance or adversary to be defeated. Up until a judicial injunction is ordered, at best I have been subjected to extreme torture, albeit while having amphetamine to ease the pain and fight on, to instill a false belief that I was merely imagining things rather than victim of despicable attacks.
I have not heard any fluent Russian but have Chinese when attacked. Obviously this is a “War” Department PsyOps.I could go through the specifics of literally 100% accurate since at least 2018 “psychosis” I was accused of naturally experiencing via schizophrenia or drug induced psychosis.
“Psy ops” usually means psychological operations: organized efforts to influence how a target audience thinks, feels, and behaves using information, messaging, symbols, and social pressure—often in military, intelligence, political, or marketing contexts.
What it looks like in practice
Shaping perceptions: reframing events so people interpret them a certain way


Changing behavior: nudging people to comply, abstain, protest, surrender, vote, buy, etc.


Eroding trust: making people doubt institutions, media, experts, or each other


Creating confusion: flooding with contradictions so “nothing feels knowable” (sometimes called firehose of falsehood)


Common channels & tactics (high level)
Narratives: repeated storylines (“they’re all corrupt,” “it’s hopeless,” “they’re coming for you”)


Social proof: bots/brigades to make an idea seem popular


Identity triggers: us-vs-them framing, moral outrage, humiliation


Selective truth: real facts + misleading context (often more effective than pure lies)


Timing & targeting: pushing messages when emotions are high (crisis moments)


How to spot it (practical checklist)
It spikes your emotion fast (rage, fear, disgust) and demands instant sharing.


Claims are hard to verify, but feel “too perfect.”


Accounts act coordinated: same phrasing, same hashtags, same talking points.


Evidence is screenshots instead of sources, or “everyone knows.”


It attacks trust broadly (“all media lies,” “all scientists are bought”).


How to defend yourself
Pause + downshift emotion (psy ops feed on urgency).


Verify via primary sources (official docs, full video, reputable reporting).


Check provenance: who posted first, when, and what they stand to gain.


Look for independent confirmation from multiple credible outlets.


Don’t amplify questionable content—even to dunk on it.


If you tell me what context you mean—military history, online disinfo, politics, or just the slang “that’s psy ops”—I’ll tailor it.


This motion is supported by Plaintiff’s Declaration (Attachment 1) and the attachments below.

ATTACHMENT LIST (PLAIN ENGLISH)
Attachment 1 — Bo Shang Declaration (sworn statement)


Attachment 2 — Timeline + Device/Account Inventory (public version with redactions; full version impounded if directed)


Attachment 3 — System Update / Firmware / Build Evidence (update history, build numbers, version fingerprints, receipts)


Attachment 4 — Trust / Signing Evidence (certificate-chain metadata; signature/trust indicators; update manifest/receipt metadata; “channel/build” markers)


Attachment 5 — Cross-Platform Consistency Indicators (recurrence correlated to system builds/updates; persistence patterns)


Attachment 6 — Proposed Early Discovery Questions (fact-of-use only; served only if allowed)


Attachment 7 — Proposed “Keep Sensitive Stuff Sealed” Rules (protective rules)


Attachment 8 — Proposed Order


Attachment 9 — SEALED APPENDIX: Plaintiff Identifiers (devices, accounts, phone numbers, emails, IPs, etc.)



1. WHAT PLAINTIFF IS ASKING FOR
Plaintiff asks the Court to enter an order that:
A. Stops the disputed conduct (as to Plaintiff only) and preserves evidence
Enter a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) and set a prompt preliminary injunction hearing that:
Bars Defendants (and anyone acting for them) from conducting or directing RoT signing-chain targeting activity as to Plaintiff Identifiers while this case is pending; and


Requires preservation of records so the Court can determine what happened.


B. Allows a small set of early “fact-of-use” questions
Authorize Plaintiff to serve Attachment 6 before the ordinary discovery schedule, limited to:
Yes/no fact-of-use (did any Defendant do it or direct it as to Plaintiff’s identifiers?), and


Minimal identifying metadata of any authorizing instrument (date, issuing authority/court, docket/case number, instrument type), without technical method disclosure.


C. Keeps sensitive identifiers and sensitive technical details off the public docket
Adopt Attachment 7 and seal/impound Attachment 9 so Plaintiff’s identifiers are not posted publicly.
D. If Defendants refuse to answer, require a judge-usable basis
If Defendants invoke privilege, state secrets, or national security, require either:
A privilege description sufficient for judicial review without revealing sensitive methods; and/or


A sealed, judge-only statement confirming whether responsive activity occurred as to Plaintiff, and stating the category of privilege asserted.



2. BASIC BACKGROUND (ALLEGATIONS SUPPORTED BY ATTACHMENTS)
A. Ongoing interference and anomalies across devices (as alleged)
From approximately 2018 (but possibly earlier) to the present (December 22 2025), Plaintiff alleges persistent and escalating anomalies across multiple devices and accounts, documented in Attachments 2–5, including [your 5–10 strongest objective items with dates].
B. Core technical allegation: RoT signing-chain misuse (RSA-2048) as the 
primary and only alleged technical mechanism
Plaintiff’s core allegation is narrow: that the interference experienced by Plaintiff is consistent with misuse of a vendor Root-of-Trust code-signing chain (including RSA-2048) to cause Plaintiff’s devices to accept validly signed firmware/OS/system components that are non-ordinary for Plaintiff (e.g., non-standard builds, special builds, targeted delivery outside ordinary public update paths), as reflected by the update/build/trust artifacts in Attachments 3–4 and the timeline correlation in Attachments 2 and 5.
Plaintiff is not asking the Court to rule that RSA-2048 is “broken,” or to adopt technical causation as established. Plaintiff asks for a TRO to stop Plaintiff-specific targeting, immediate preservation, and limited “fact-of-use” discovery to determine whether any Defendant did or directed such activity.
C. Why “everything is legitimately signed” does not resolve the problem
Plaintiff’s allegation does not depend on unsigned code or failed verification. A RoT/signing-chain misuse theory is precisely a situation where protections appear intact—because the device is doing what it was designed to do: accept code authenticated through trusted signing.
The issue is not whether signatures verify; the issue is whether the signing pipeline and RoT trust were used to deliver validly signed but non-ordinary system components targeted to Plaintiff.
D. Additional conduct (without adding other technical vectors)
Plaintiff also alleges episodic behavior that appears disruptive, coercive, or harassing in context. Plaintiff raises this as part of the overall pattern and harm. Plaintiff’s requested relief and requested discovery remain narrowly focused on the RoT/signing-chain mechanism and Plaintiff-specific fact-of-use.
E. Why this requires emergency handling
Records and device artifacts can be overwritten quickly by ordinary retention policies and routine system updates. Plaintiff alleges the harm is ongoing or likely to recur. Delay risks evidence loss and undermines judicial review.

3. RSA-2048 ROOT-OF-TRUST VECTORS (ONLY) — PRESENTED AS TESTABLE HYPOTHESES
Plaintiff presents the following RoT/signing-chain hypotheses only, consistent with the attachments, to explain how “legitimately signed” components could nevertheless be used wrongfully as to Plaintiff:
Vector 1 — Misuse or compromise of a trusted signing key (or chain) to sign a non-ordinary system image delivered to Plaintiff
If a trusted signing key or a trusted intermediate were misused, it could produce images that verify as authentic while still being non-ordinary or targeted as to Plaintiff.
Artifacts sought/preserved: build identifiers; receipt/manifest metadata; chain metadata; timing correlation (Attachments 2–4).
Vector 2 — Use/misuse of a trusted intermediate signing authority to issue targeted “valid” images
Even without a top-level root compromise, misuse of an intermediate authority could produce valid signatures accepted by devices.
Artifacts: signer-chain identifiers; certificate metadata; update/build fingerprints (Attachment 4).
Vector 3 — Use of a “special build” pipeline authenticated by the same RSA-2048 signing regime
Some ecosystems support internal/special builds that remain cryptographically valid. If such a pipeline were used as to Plaintiff, the device would treat it as legitimate.
Artifacts: channel/build markers; non-ordinary version sequences; update events inconsistent with ordinary delivery for Plaintiff (Attachments 3–5).
Vector 4 — Provisioning/trust-binding differences that change which signer is treated as trusted
If a device is bound at provisioning to accept a non-ordinary trust chain, later components can still be “legitimately signed,” just under the bound chain.
Artifacts: attestation/verification metadata where available; acceptance patterns inconsistent with expected channel history (Attachments 3–5).
Again, Plaintiff does not ask the Court to decide which hypothesis is true today—only to stop Plaintiff-specific targeting, preserve evidence, and authorize limited discovery to determine whether any Defendant did or directed such activity.

4. WHY THIS COURT CAN (AND SHOULD) ACT NOW
A. Emergency relief is appropriate when harm is ongoing and evidence is at risk
A TRO/PI preserves the status quo and prevents continuing harm while the Court assesses the merits. Plaintiff seeks Plaintiff-only relief and preservation, not broad relief or public disclosure of sensitive methods.
B. Early discovery is appropriate because the “yes/no” facts are uniquely in Defendants’ hands
Plaintiff cannot prove from public sources whether Defendants conducted or directed RoT/signing-chain targeting as to Plaintiff. If Defendants did not, the Court should be able to obtain a clear denial. If any Defendant did, the Court should be able to determine whether there was an authorizing instrument at a metadata level, without forcing method disclosure.
C. Sealing resolves legitimate sensitivity
Plaintiff proposes a sealed/in-camera framework so the Court can decide threshold facts without public disclosure of Plaintiff identifiers or sensitive technical details.

5. THE REQUEST IS NARROW ON PURPOSE
Plaintiff does not seek exploit code, vulnerabilities, implants, source code, step-by-step methods, targets, operational details, or sources/methods.
Plaintiff seeks only:
Stop Plaintiff-specific RoT/signing-chain targeting;


Preserve evidence; and


Answer “did this happen to Plaintiff?” plus minimal authorizing-instrument metadata if it did.



6. SEALING / IMPOUNDMENT REQUEST (IDENTIFIERS)
Plaintiff requests that Attachment 9 (Plaintiff Identifiers) be sealed/impounded and that any filing revealing Plaintiff identifiers be submitted under seal. Plaintiff will file a redacted public version where feasible.

7. NOTICE / CERTIFICATION (FILL THIS IN)
Plaintiff certifies:
Notice attempts: On [date/time], Plaintiff [emailed/called/served] [USAO/DOJ contact if known] to provide notice of this emergency motion and request a prompt response.


If notice was not feasible: Plaintiff explains that [immediate harm / evidence risk] required shortened notice.



8. REQUESTED SCHEDULE
Plaintiff requests the Court:
issue a TRO immediately (or set a hearing within [7–14] days);


allow Plaintiff to serve Attachment 6 within [14] days;


require responses within [21] days of service; and


adopt Attachment 7 and seal Attachment 9 immediately.



9. CONCLUSION
Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant the requested TRO/preservation order, set a prompt preliminary injunction hearing, allow limited early fact-of-use discovery in Attachment 6, adopt the sealing/access rules in Attachment 7, and seal Attachment 9.

ATTACHMENT 8 — [PROPOSED] ORDER
STOPPING PLAINTIFF-SPECIFIC ROT SIGNING-CHAIN TARGETING, PRESERVING EVIDENCE, LIMITED EARLY FACT-OF-USE DISCOVERY, AND SEALING SENSITIVE IDENTIFIERS
After reviewing Plaintiff’s emergency motion and supporting materials, the Court ORDERS:
A. Terms used in this Order
“Plaintiff Identifiers” are listed in Attachment 9 (SEALED APPENDIX).


“Sensitive technical details” means exploit code, vulnerabilities, step-by-step method descriptions, implant mechanics, or other operational technique details.


“RoT signing-chain targeting activity” means knowingly conducting or directing, as to any Plaintiff Identifier, the creation, signing, distribution, delivery, installation, or facilitation of installation of any firmware/bootloader/OS/system image or update that is validly authenticated through a vendor Root-of-Trust code-signing chain (including RSA-2048) but is non-ordinary for Plaintiff’s device(s) or outside the standard public update path applicable to those device(s).


B. Temporary restraining order (Plaintiff-only scope)
Defendants, and anyone acting for or with them, must not knowingly conduct or direct RoT signing-chain targeting activity as defined above as to any Plaintiff Identifier during the pendency of this case, except routine public updates generally delivered to the public/device population in the ordinary course.
Nothing in this Order requires disclosure of Sensitive technical details.
C. Preservation of evidence
Defendants must take reasonable steps to preserve records and ESI sufficient to determine whether any Defendant (or anyone acting for them) conducted or directed RoT signing-chain targeting activity as to Plaintiff Identifiers during [DATE–DATE], including (where applicable):
Records sufficient to show whether any such activity occurred as to Plaintiff Identifiers;


Identifying metadata of any authorizing instrument (date; issuing authority/court; docket/case number; instrument type), if any; and


Non-methodological metadata sufficient to identify any system image/update/build delivered/installed as to Plaintiff Identifiers during [DATE–DATE] (e.g., build identifiers; version fingerprints; update receipt/manifest metadata), subject to any privilege claims.


D. Preliminary injunction hearing
The Court sets a preliminary injunction hearing for [date/time].
Opposition due [date]. Reply due [date] (or as otherwise ordered).
E. Limited early discovery (fact-of-use only)
Plaintiff may serve the Proposed Early Discovery Questions in Attachment 6 within [14] days. Defendants must respond within [21] days. Discovery is limited to Plaintiff-specific fact-of-use admissions/denials and identifying metadata of any authorizing instrument. No Sensitive technical details are required; any such information may be submitted under seal/in camera.
F. If Defendants refuse to answer (privilege / national security)
If Defendants withhold information or state they can neither confirm nor deny publicly, Defendants must provide:
A privilege description sufficient for judicial review without disclosing Sensitive technical details; and/or


A sealed judge-only statement indicating whether responsive RoT signing-chain targeting activity occurred as to Plaintiff Identifiers and stating the category of privilege asserted.


G. Sealing / impoundment
Attachment 9 is sealed/impounded. Any filing that reveals Plaintiff Identifiers must be submitted under seal. The Court adopts the sealing/access rules in Attachment 7.
SO ORDERED.
Date: ____________            ______________________________
